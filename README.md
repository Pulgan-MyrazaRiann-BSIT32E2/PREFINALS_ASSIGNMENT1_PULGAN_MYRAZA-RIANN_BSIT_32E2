Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)
Conceptual Understanding:
 
Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
 
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?
 YES
 
 
MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 
 
Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
 
 YES
 
Web API: (Yes/No) 
 
Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?
 
 YES
 

Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture:
 
 
Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
 
 
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)
 
-Flexibility
-Decoupling
-Scalability
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
 
 YES
 

MVC:
 
 
Components: (1-3 keywords each)
 
 
Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.
 
 Model: Represents the data and business logic.
View: Represents the UI and presentation layer.
Controller: Manages user input and interactions, updating the model and view.
 
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 Yes: Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application.
Web API
 
Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
 
 
 

Web API:
 
 
Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
 - Traditional MVC applications are focused on delivering views (HTML pages) whereas Web APIs are designed to provide data (usually in JSON or XML format) for client applications to consume.
 
 
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)
 - Yes: Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead in MVC, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach in Web APIs.
